ID,Feature(s),Type,Business intuition,H0 (null),H1 (alternative),How to test (EDA / stats / ML),Expected direction
H1,education-num (or education),Numeric / Categorical,Higher education is linked to higher-paying occupations and wages.,Income class is independent of education level.,Higher education level increases the likelihood of income >50K.,Compare >50K rate by education; trend vs education-num; chi-square for education; logistic coef / SHAP for direction.,+
H2,age,Numeric,Income often rises with experience and seniority.,Income class is independent of age.,Higher age is associated with higher likelihood of income >50K.,Plot >50K rate by age bins; t-test/KS test on age by class; model partial dependence.,+
H3,hours-per-week,Numeric,More work hours often correspond to full-time/professional roles.,Income class is independent of hours worked per week.,More hours-per-week increases the likelihood of income >50K.,Boxplots by class; compare means/medians; fit logistic with hours; check monotonic pattern.,+
H4,capital-gain,Numeric,Investment gains are more common among higher-income individuals.,Income class is independent of capital-gain.,Higher (or non-zero) capital-gain increases likelihood of income >50K.,Compare >50K rate for capital-gain=0 vs >0; log-transform then compare; model importance.,+ (strong)
H5,occupation,Categorical,Different occupations have very different pay scales.,Income class distribution is the same across occupations.,Income class distribution differs by occupation.,Bar chart of >50K rate by occupation; chi-square test; model coefficients per category.,Varies by category
H6,marital-status,Categorical,"Marital status correlates with household structure, age, and earnings.",Income class distribution is the same across marital-status categories.,Income class distribution differs by marital-status.,Bar chart of >50K rate by marital-status; chi-square; check model category effects.,Varies by category
H7,workclass,Categorical,Employer type (private/government/self-employed) can affect pay bands.,Income class distribution is the same across workclass.,Income class distribution differs by workclass.,Bar chart of >50K rate by workclass; chi-square; model category weights.,Varies by category
H8,sex,Categorical (sensitive),Historical wage gaps may be reflected in the data.,Income class distribution is the same across sex categories.,Income class distribution differs across sex categories.,Compare >50K rates by sex; chi-square; fairness metrics (TPR/FPR parity) after modeling.,Difference expected (bias risk)
H9,race,Categorical (sensitive),Historical inequities may appear in outcomes.,Income class distribution is the same across race categories.,Income class distribution differs across race categories.,Compare >50K rates by race; chi-square; fairness checks on model errors by group.,Difference expected (bias risk)
H10,education-num × hours-per-week,Interaction,Extra hours may pay off more in higher-skill roles.,No interaction: the effect of hours-per-week does not change with education.,Interaction exists: the effect of hours-per-week on >50K probability depends on education.,Fit logistic with interaction term; compare AUC/F1; plot partial dependence for hours at different education levels.,Stronger + effect at higher education
